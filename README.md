Once you have completed the assignment, edit the README.md file in your repository with the following information: 

1. Your name and email address 

Kaleb Amarante and kamarante@my.waketech.edu

2. A brief description of your Github account 

https://github.com/Kaleb47 this my github account. It contains a sort of HTML resume of my languages and accomplishments, below that are my most recent repositiories and git organizations that I am in. I mostly use github for work but I do contirbute to free-opensourced projects occasionallly. 

3. A brief description of the repository you created 

This is a simple public github repository with a readme file for a homework assignment.

4. A brief description of the steps you took to clone the repository onto your local machine 

First of all, I refused to download the github desktop, mostly bdecause I already know how to use the git cli to clone and commit repositories and github desktop is riddled with bugs.

I created the this repo on github.com, named it Kaleb47.github.io

I cloned the repo like so
```git clone https://github.com/Kaleb47/Kaleb47.github.io.git```

I contributed code to it via markdown text in my vs code.

and then I pushed changes to github like so
```git add .```
```git commit -m "My assignment"```
```git push ```
